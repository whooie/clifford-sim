# Measurement-induced phase transition simulations

Tools for simulation measurement-induced phase transitions in *N*-qubit systems.

Currently supported:
- Efficient simulation via the Gottesman-Knill tableau representation of
  stabilizer states
- (In)Efficient simulation via a quasi-binary tree representation
- Random sampling from the complete *N*-qubit Clifford group
- Projective measurements

Planned:
- Complete randomized Clifford circuits with probabilistic measurements and
  post-selection
- Renormalization methods
